# Magnify Submission

## Overview

This application was created as part of the hiring process for Magnify Access. The requirements of the application included:

 - Creating a submission form where employees include information on identification information (name, ID, department, employment status, email), accommodation requests, and upload files (for documentation). 
- Store the Submission Form information in a database.
- Create a lookup form to allow Human Resources to review and filter by the Submission Form fields

Along with these requirements, I added in a login/log out feature for users, and included an HR field that users can select when signing up, allowing them to distinguish themselves as an employee or HR. I used JWT Authentication for this functionality.
